                   to investigate how people unintentionally remember information, \
                   and whether this is accomplished better or worse when more time is available. To \
                   that end we tested your memory for the six words of the last trial. \
                   We varied the free time following each of the words - either only \
                   100 ms or 5000 ms after each word. We expect that participants who had more \
                   time following the words are able to remember them better.</p><p>Please do not share \
                   this information with anyone! It is crucial the explanation is kept confidential until we \
                   have collected all data.</p><p>Here is your code to confirm your participation: IncMem_73_1</p>\
